In Warehouse Robot, The Reinforcement Learning is enabling agent (Robot) to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment.

Warehouse game is a grid-based RL game environment, implemented using the Gym library, which provides a rich platform for training and evaluating agents in a simulated world.

GridWorld RL games in general challenges agents to navigate through a dynamic grid environment, where they encounter obstacles and rewards.

Creating a custom environment in Gym involves defining the state space, action space, reward structure, and transition dynamics that govern agent-environment interaction. 

By adhering to Gym's standardized interface, custom environments seamlessly integrate with existing RL algorithms and evaluation methodologies, enabling rigorous experimentation and comparison across different domains.
